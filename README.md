# movie_recommender_system

Developed a movie recommendation system using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) that calculates cosine similarity between movies based on user ratings. Integrated into a user-friendly web app using Streamlit, providing an interactive platform for users to receive personalized movie recommendations. The system includes data preprocessing, user-item matrix creation, cosine similarity computation, and evaluation metrics. This project showcases a practical application of collaborative filtering and enhances user engagement through an intuitive web interface.
